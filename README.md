Demonstrate Page Replacement Algorithms of Operating systems using Raptor tool

RAPTOR Tool – A Flowchart Interpreter
RAPTOR(Rapid Algorithmic Prototyping Tool for Ordered Reasoning) is a free graphical authoring tool
Students can create flow-chart for a particular program and raptor tool will generate code for it in various programming languages, such as C, C++, Java and so on.

Symbols in RAPTOR
Raptor has 6 types of symbols, each of which represents a unique kind of instruction. They are – Assignment, Call, Input, Output, Selection and Loop symbols.
A RAPTOR program consists of connected symbols that represent actions to be executed.
The arrows that connect the symbols determine the order in which the actions are performed.
The execution of a RAPTOR program begins at the Start symbol and goes along the arrows to execute the program.
The program stops executing when the End symbol is reached.
With the help of Generate option, we can generate corresponding code for the flow chart.
